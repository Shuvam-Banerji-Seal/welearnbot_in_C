# WeLearn Downloader

A modern C application for automating resource downloads from the WeLearn platform. Available in both command-line (CLI) and graphical (GTK4 GUI) versions.

**Warning:** This tool uses simple XOR encryption for storing credentials, which is **NOT SECURE**. Do not use it with sensitive accounts.

## Features

* **GUI Version** - Modern GTK4 graphical interface with:
  - User-friendly login form
  - Real-time download progress
  - Activity log viewer
  - Credential management
* **CLI Version** - Enhanced command-line interface with:
  - **Interactive file selection** - Choose specific files to download
  - **Tree/List view** - View files hierarchically or in simple list format
  - **Custom download directory** - Specify where files should be saved
  - **Selective downloading** - Download all or specific files by number
  - Traditional "download all" mode for quick batch downloads
* Automated login and session management
* Course navigation and resource extraction
* Smart file naming and organization
* Duplicate detection
* Folder recursion support
* Credential storage (basic encryption)

## Dependencies

### Required (for CLI version)
* **libcurl** - HTTP client library
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`
  - Fedora/CentOS/RHEL: `sudo dnf install curl-devel`
* **zlib** - Compression library
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev`
  - Fedora/CentOS/RHEL: `sudo dnf install zlib-devel`
* **OpenSSL** - Cryptography library
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
  - Fedora/CentOS/RHEL: `sudo dnf install openssl-devel`

### Optional (for GUI version)
* **GTK4** - GUI toolkit (version 4.x)
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libgtk-4-dev`
  - Fedora/CentOS/RHEL: `sudo dnf install gtk4-devel`

## Installation

### Quick Install (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Install all dependencies (including GUI)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libgtk-4-dev

# Build both versions
make

# Or install system-wide
make install
```

### Build Options

```bash
# Build both CLI and GUI (if GTK4 available)
make

# Build only CLI version
make cli

# Build only GUI version
make gui

# Clean and rebuild
make clean all

# Show all available targets
make help
```

## Usage

### GUI Version

Simply run the graphical application:

```bash
./welearn_gui
```

The GUI provides:
1. **Login Form** - Enter your WeLearn credentials
2. **Save Credentials** - Option to save credentials for future use
3. **Download Button** - Start downloading all courses
4. **Progress Bar** - Visual feedback on download progress
5. **Activity Log** - Real-time log of all operations

### CLI Version

Run the command-line application:

```bash
./welearn_cli
```

#### Interactive Mode (NEW!)

The CLI now offers two modes:

**Mode 1: Download All Files (Original Behavior)**
- Automatically downloads all files from all courses
- Downloads to current directory
- No user interaction required

**Mode 2: Interactive File Selection (NEW)**

When you select Mode 2, you get:

1. **Course Scanning** - Scans all enrolled courses and collects file information
2. **Display Options**:
   - **Tree View**: Hierarchical display with folders and files organized by course
   - **List View**: Simple table showing all files with course names
3. **Custom Download Directory** - Choose where to save files (default: current directory)
4. **File Selection**:
   - Enter `all` to download all files
   - Enter specific file numbers separated by commas (e.g., `1,3,5,7`)
   - Enter `q` to quit without downloading

#### Example Usage Flow

```bash
$ ./welearn_cli

# After login...
Choose an option:
1. Download all files (old behavior)
2. Select specific files to download (new)

Enter choice (1 or 2): 2

# Files are scanned...
How would you like to view the files?
1. Tree view (hierarchical)
2. List view (simple table)

Enter choice (1 or 2): 1

# Tree view displayed...
üìö Course: Data Structures
  üìÑ [1] Lecture_1_Introduction.pdf
  üìÑ [2] Assignment_1.pdf
  üìÅ [3] Week_2_Materials (folder)
    üìÑ [4] Lecture_2.pdf

Enter download directory path (press Enter for current directory '.'): ./downloads

Select files to download:
  - Enter 'all' to download all files
  - Enter file numbers separated by commas (e.g., 1,3,5,7)
  - Enter 'q' to quit without downloading

Your selection: 1,2,4

# Downloads only files 1, 2, and 4...
```

#### Legacy Behavior

The original "download everything" behavior is preserved as Mode 1 for users who prefer the automatic approach.

## Configuration

### Credential Storage

* Credentials are saved to `credentials.dat` (encrypted with XOR)
* The encryption key is defined as `ENCRYPTION_KEY 'S'`
* **Important**: This is NOT secure encryption - use at your own risk

### Download Location

* Files are downloaded to the current directory
* Each course gets its own folder (named after the course title)
* Existing files are automatically skipped

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
* GCC compiler (or compatible C compiler)
* Make build system
* Development libraries installed (see Dependencies)

### Compilation

The Makefile automatically detects available libraries:

```bash
# Standard build
make

# Verbose build (shows compilation commands)
make VERBOSE=1

# Build with debug symbols
make CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -g -Iinclude"
```

### Cross-Platform Notes

#### Linux
The default target platform. All features fully supported.

#### Windows
You'll need to:
1. Install MinGW or similar compiler
2. Install libcurl, zlib, OpenSSL for Windows
3. Adjust include and library paths in the Makefile
4. Use `mingw32-make` instead of `make`

#### macOS
Install dependencies via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install curl openssl gtk4
```

## Architecture

The application is modularized into several components:

### Core Modules

1. **welearn_common** - Shared utilities
   - Memory management for HTTP responses
   - URL visited tracking
   - File/path sanitization
   - Directory creation

2. **welearn_auth** - Authentication
   - Login token extraction
   - Credential encryption/decryption
   - Secure password input
   - Credential persistence

3. **welearn_download** - Download logic
   - File downloading with resume support
   - Course page parsing
   - Folder recursion
   - Smart filename detection

4. **welearn_cli** - CLI interface
   - Command-line user interaction
   - Terminal output formatting

5. **welearn_gui** - GTK4 GUI
   - Modern graphical interface
   - Multi-threaded downloads
   - Progress indication
   - Log viewer

## Limitations

* **Security**: Credential storage uses weak XOR encryption
* **Website Changes**: May break if WeLearn's HTML structure changes
* **Rate Limiting**: No delay between requests (could trigger anti-bot measures)
* **Error Recovery**: Limited handling of network interruptions
* **Platform Support**: GUI requires GTK4 (Linux primarily)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Problem**: `Package gtk4 was not found`
```bash
# Solution: Install GTK4 development libraries
sudo apt-get install libgtk-4-dev
```

**Problem**: `curl/curl.h: No such file or directory`
```bash
# Solution: Install libcurl development files
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: "Failed to initialize libcurl"
```bash
# Ensure libcurl is installed
sudo apt-get install libcurl4
```

**Problem**: GUI doesn't start
```bash
# Check GTK4 runtime is installed
sudo apt-get install libgtk-4-1

# Run with debug info
GTK_DEBUG=interactive ./welearn_gui
```

**Problem**: Login fails
- Verify your credentials are correct
- Check if WeLearn website is accessible
- Ensure cookies.txt can be created in the current directory

## Development

### Code Style
- Follow Linux kernel coding style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Adding Features
1. Add new headers to `include/` if needed
2. Implement in appropriate `src/` file
3. Update Makefile if adding new files
4. Update README with new features

### Testing
```bash
# Build with debug symbols
make clean
make CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -g -Iinclude"

# Run with valgrind (memory leak detection)
valgrind --leak-check=full ./welearn_cli

# Run with gdb (debugging)
gdb ./welearn_cli
```
